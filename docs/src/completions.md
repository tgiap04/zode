# Completions

Zode supports two sources for completions:

1. "Code Completions" provided by Language Servers (LSPs) automatically installed by Zode or via [Zode Language Extensions](languages.md).
2. "Edit Predictions" provided by Zode's own Zeta model or by external providers like [GitHub Copilot](#github-copilot).

## Language Server Code Completions {#code-completions}

When there is an appropriate language server available, Zode will provide completions of variable names, functions, and other symbols in the current file. You can disable these by adding the following to your Zode `settings.json` file:

```json [settings]
"show_completions_on_input": false
```

You can manually trigger completions with `ctrl-space` or by triggering the `editor::ShowCompletions` action from the command palette.

> Note: Using `ctrl-space` in Zode requires disabling the macOS global shortcut.
> Open **System Settings** > **Keyboard** > **Keyboard Shortcut**s >
> **Input Sources** and uncheck **Select the previous input source**.

For more information, see:

- [Configuring Supported Languages](./configuring-languages.md)
- [List of Zode Supported Languages](./languages.md)

## Edit Predictions {#edit-predictions}

Zode has built-in support for predicting multiple edits at a time [via Zeta](https://huggingface.co/zed-industries/zeta), Zode's open-source and open-data model.
Edit predictions appear as you type, and most of the time, you can accept them by pressing `tab`.
